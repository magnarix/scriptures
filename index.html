            <h2 class="statement-title">Statement on Federal Immigration Enforcement Operations in Raleigh, North Carolina</h2>
            
            <div class="statement-content">
                <p>We have received credible reports of an impending enforcement operation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol in Raleigh, North Carolina, set to begin as early as tomorrow. As North Carolina Governor Josh Stein has clearly stated, when federal efforts target violent criminals and drug traffickers who are in the United States illegally, we stand in full support of upholding the rule of law and public safety. I echo Governor Stein's call for focused, just enforcement that protects our communities without sowing fear.</p>

                <p>We also affirm the wisdom of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), which reminds us in their recent Special Message on Immigration that every nation, including the United States, has a moral and practical responsibility to secure its borders and establish a just immigration system for the common good. Human dignity and national security are not in opposition; they can—and must—coexist through compassionate, lawful action.</p>

                <p>However, as Governor Stein, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell, and officials across North Carolina and other states have reported, this is not always the reality on the ground. Official reports and eyewitness accounts from recent operations in Charlotte reveal a troubling pattern: ICE agents targeting law-abiding U.S. citizens and legal residents, often through racial profiling based on appearance, language, or ethnicity. U.S. citizens have been detained in such "collateral arrests" nationwide, enduring unwarranted stops, detentions, and even brutality that erodes trust and divides families. This is not enforcement; it is a despicable and immoral violation of human dignity.</p>

                <p>When individuals claiming the authority of law enforcement unlawfully target innocent civilians—detaining them without probable cause or a warrant, relying on racial bias rather than evidence—they cross into criminal territory. They become criminals masquerading as officers, employing the very brutality and tactics of the gangs, militias, and thugs they are sworn to dismantle. No badge shields such actions from accountability. The excuse of "just following orders" offers no absolution when those orders are unlawful and unjust; it is, instead, a confession of moral surrender.</p>

                <p>I urgently call on all law enforcement officials, including those with ICE and Border Patrol, to identify themselves clearly when requested, respectfully and honorably, and to conduct every arrest with a valid warrant or established probable cause—not prejudice. Being a law enforcement officer grants no immunity from earthly justice or God's final judgment. Though some may feel "untouchable" in this world, no conduct escapes notice. You—and every link in your chain of command—will one day answer for these actions before the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

                <p>To those in ICE who profess the Catholic faith: Examine your conscience deeply. The teachings of the Catholic Church on loving our neighbors and welcoming the stranger are unequivocal, as articulated by the USCCB: Nations must regulate borders justly, but never at the expense of mercy, dignity, or the Gospel's command to protect the vulnerable. If your duties lead you into conflict with these truths, I implore you to reconsider your path—whether by advocating for change within your agency or, prayerfully, stepping away to realign with the Church's witness. Uphold the faith in your service, or let it guide you to a calling that does not demand compromise.</p>

                <div class="divider"></div>

                <p>We pray for wisdom, justice, and reconciliation in this moment. Let us build a nation where borders are secure, but hearts remain open. May God bless the people of North Carolina, our leaders, and all who seek a more humane path forward.</p>
